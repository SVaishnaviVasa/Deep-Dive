# Deep-Dive
## Overview
"Deep Dive" is an advanced real-time underwater threat detection and alert system designed to enhance diver safety and foster a community of knowledge sharing. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as OpenCV and YOLO for object detection, paired with a full-stack development approach using React for the front-end and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back-end.

## Key Features
Real-Time Underwater Threat Detection: Utilizes computer vision technologies like OpenCV and YOLO to identify and classify potential underwater threats in real time, ensuring divers are alerted promptly.
User-Friendly Interface: The front-end is built with React, providing an intuitive platform where researchers and divers can easily upload, access, and share their latest underwater findings.
Knowledge Sharing: Designed to act as a comprehensive educational resource, Deep Dive allows users to contribute data, fostering collaboration and enhancing diver awareness about potential hazards.
Secure and Scalable Back-End: Built with Node.js and Express, the back-end infrastructure is designed to handle large volumes of data while maintaining robust security measures, ensuring the platform remains a trusted resource for researchers.
Community Building: Through seamless integration with MongoDB, the platform supports a growing community of divers and researchers, facilitating knowledge exchange and discussions about underwater safety.

## Purpose
The main objective of "Deep Dive" is to enhance diver safety by integrating technology into underwater exploration. By providing a platform where researchers can share their findings and insights, the project creates a learning hub for novice and experienced divers alike, helping them stay informed about potential threats and best practices.

## Future Improvements
Enhanced Threat Detection Accuracy: Continuous updates to the YOLO model to improve the accuracy of underwater object detection.
Mobile Integration: Development of a mobile app to extend the platformâ€™s accessibility to divers on the go.
Machine Learning Enhancements: Future iterations could incorporate machine learning to predict potential threats based on environmental data and historical patterns.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
